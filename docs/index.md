# The Amazing Technical Writing Recipe Book

This is a little side project to help the TW team to practice their writing and gain some experience using MkDocs and Github (probably).

## What is this site about?

The idea began with Aaron losing his mind due to a terrible written recipe book. He thought that to achieve an easy to follow recipe book, it should be written by Technical Writers.
That's when he reached out to Arturo, aka Chino, and Pepe for some help, so they began to reasearch about different ways to create this site. They started learning how MkDocs work and
that's how this idea came to life! 

Pretty cool, huh?
